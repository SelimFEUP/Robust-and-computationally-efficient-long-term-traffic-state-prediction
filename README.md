# Spatial-Temporal Robust Multi-step Traffic State Prediction
This repository presents a ''Long-Term Multi-Intersection Traffic State Prediction Using Attention Mechanism and Residual Temporal Convolutional Networks''.

# Note
Data augmentation was only applied to transformed_data.csv; PEMS-BAY and METR-LA do not require it.


# Usage
From the terminal run 'python3 ./src/proposed_model_pems.py'
